    <h1>Planting Guide</h1>
    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <p>
        Magnolia is an ancient genus. Appearing before bees evolved, 
        the flowers are theorized to have evolved to encourage 
        pollination by beetles. To avoid damage from pollinating 
        beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely 
        tough. Fossilized specimens of M. acuminata have been 
        found dating to 20 million years ago, and fossils of 
        plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date 
        to 95 million years ago. Another aspect of Magnolia 
        considered to represent an ancestral state is that 
        the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in 
        sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and 
        called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals.

    <h2>Ranunculus</h2>
    <p>
        The genus is distributed in Europe, North America 
        and South America. The familiar and widespread 
        buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and 
        introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup 
        Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and 
        tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, 
        the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much 
        taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental 
        gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds. 
        Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers 
        may be found throughout the summer, especially where  
        the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers,  
        as in the case of garden weeds.

    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <p>
        Tulips (Tulipa) are a genus of spring-blooming perennial 
        herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (having bulbs as 
        storage organs). The flowers are usually large, showy 
        and brightly coloured, generally red, pink, yellow, 
        or white (usually in warm colours). They often have a 
        different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals 
        (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because 
        of a degree of variability within the populations, and 
        a long history of cultivation, classification has been 
        complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the 
        lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, 
        where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium 
        and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.
