    <h2>Rhodes piano</h2>
    <p class="one">
        The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical piano, 
        invented by Harold Rhodes during the fifties 
        and later manufactured in a number of models, 
        first in collaboration with Fender and after 
        1965 by CBS. It employs a piano-like keyboard 
        with hammers that hit small metal tines, amplified 
        by electromagnetic pickups.
